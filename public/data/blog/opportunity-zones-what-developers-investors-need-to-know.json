The core idea is simple: roll capital gains into a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF), deploy that capital into Opportunity Zone projects, and get rewarded for patient capital.\n\n## How OZs work\n\nInvestors can defer, reduce, or eliminate capital gains taxes by reinvesting gains into QOFs, which then deploy capital into Qualified Opportunity Zone Businesses (QOZBs) or property.\n\n### Key benefits\n\n- **Deferral** of original capital gains until the legislated recognition date\n- **Potential reduction** of taxable gains based on prior holding provisions\n- **Elimination of gains** on the OZ investment itself when held 10+ years\n\n## What makes OZs unique\n\nUnlike other tax-credit programs:\n\n- There is **no allocation authority** or centralized award process\n- Capital is **market-driven** and depends on investor appetite\n- Compliance hinges on **asset tests**, **substantial improvement**, and **working capital safe harbors**, not on tax-credit allocations\n\n## Common challenges\n\n- Maintaining the 90% QOF asset test across reporting periods\n- Designing QOZBs that can accommodate operating businesses and real estate\n- Aligning OZ rules with NMTC or HTC when projects use blended structures\n- Documenting working capital safe harbor plans and execution\n\n## How tCredex supports OZ projects\n\ntCredex provides:\n\n- **Compliance tracking** for 90% asset tests and QOZB thresholds\n- **Standardized QOZB structuring templates** for real estate and operating businesses\n- **Documentation support** for investor and regulatory reporting\n- **Integration with other programs**, so OZ can sit alongside NMTC, HTC, and state credits\n\nOpportunity Zones remain a powerful tool — but only when compliance is managed with precision and data, not guesswork."}
