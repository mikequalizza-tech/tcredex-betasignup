Modeling a capital stack correctly is essential for feasibility, compliance, and investor confidence.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all sources\n\nCommon sources include:\n\n- Senior debt\n- Subordinate or mezzanine debt\n- Sponsor equity\n- NMTC leverage loans\n- LIHTC equity\n- HTC equity\n- State credit equity or monetization proceeds\n- Philanthropic capital and grants\n\n## Step 2: Categorize each source\n\nFor each source, determine:\n\n- **Debt vs. equity**\n- **Restricted vs. unrestricted** (use of proceeds and covenants)\n- **Timing of disbursement** (upfront, over time, milestone-based)\n- **Compliance implications** (program-specific rules, use tests, recapture risks)\n\n## Step 3: Build the layering\n\nStart with:\n\n1. Senior debt\n2. Subordinate debt\n3. Tax-credit equity and related loans\n4. Sponsor equity\n5. Grants or soft funds\n\nMake sure sources and uses tie out, and that each layer is clearly defined in the model.\n\n## Step 4: Model cash flow\n\nKey items:\n\n- Debt service and coverage ratios\n- Investor returns and IRR hurdles\n- QLICI disbursements and interest-only periods for NMTC\n- Construction draws and cost-to-complete analysis\n- Developer fee timing and pay-out sources\n\n## Step 5: Validate compliance\n\nRun checks for:\n\n- QALICB tests (for NMTC)\n- Eligible basis and unit mix (for LIHTC)\n- QRE allocation and placed-in-service timing (for HTC)\n- OZ asset tests and holding periods\n- State credit-specific rules and reporting\n\n## How tCredex helps\n\ntCredex supports capital stack modeling by:\n\n- **Providing pre-built capital stack templates** for common structures\n- **Embedding compliance checks** into modeling workflows\n- **Standardizing assumptions and outputs** across deals and teams\n- **Generating documentation** that aligns with the modeled structure\n\nA well-modeled capital stack is the foundation of a successful deal — and a platform-based approach makes that modeling reusable instead of one-off."}
