Modeling a capital stack correctly is essential for feasibility, compliance, and investor confidence.\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Identify all sources\r\n\r\nCommon sources include:\r\n\r\n- Senior debt\r\n- Subordinate or mezzanine debt\r\n- Sponsor equity\r\n- NMTC leverage loans\r\n- LIHTC equity\r\n- HTC equity\r\n- State credit equity or monetization proceeds\r\n- Philanthropic capital and grants\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Categorize each source\r\n\r\nFor each source, determine:\r\n\r\n- **Debt vs. equity**\r\n- **Restricted vs. unrestricted** (use of proceeds and covenants)\r\n- **Timing of disbursement** (upfront, over time, milestone-based)\r\n- **Compliance implications** (program-specific rules, use tests, recapture risks)\r\n\r\n## Step 3: Build the layering\r\n\r\nStart with:\r\n\r\n1. Senior debt\r\n2. Subordinate debt\r\n3. Tax-credit equity and related loans\r\n4. Sponsor equity\r\n5. Grants or soft funds\r\n\r\nMake sure sources and uses tie out, and that each layer is clearly defined in the model.\r\n\r\n## Step 4: Model cash flow\r\n\r\nKey items:\r\n\r\n- Debt service and coverage ratios\r\n- Investor returns and IRR hurdles\r\n- QLICI disbursements and interest-only periods for NMTC\r\n- Construction draws and cost-to-complete analysis\r\n- Developer fee timing and pay-out sources\r\n\r\n## Step 5: Validate compliance\r\n\r\nRun checks for:\r\n\r\n- QALICB tests (for NMTC)\r\n- Eligible basis and unit mix (for LIHTC)\r\n- QRE allocation and placed-in-service timing (for HTC)\r\n- OZ asset tests and holding periods\r\n- State credit-specific rules and reporting\r\n\r\n## How tCredex helps\r\n\r\ntCredex supports capital stack modeling by:\r\n\r\n- **Providing pre-built capital stack templates** for common structures\r\n- **Embedding compliance checks** into modeling workflows\r\n- **Standardizing assumptions and outputs** across deals and teams\r\n- **Generating documentation** that aligns with the modeled structure\r\n\r\nA well-modeled capital stack is the foundation of a successful deal — and a platform-based approach makes that modeling reusable instead of one-off."}
