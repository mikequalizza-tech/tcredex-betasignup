A single oversight can jeopardize credits, trigger recapture, or derail a project.\n\n## Pitfall #1: Incomplete or inconsistent documentation\n\nMissing agreements, outdated financials, or inconsistent reporting create audit and investor risk.\n\n**Solution:**  \nUse centralized document management, standardized naming conventions, and automated checklists tied to each program's requirements.\n\n## Pitfall #2: Misaligned entity structures\n\nIncorrect layering or missing entities can invalidate credits or break allocations.\n\n**Solution:**  \nStart with validated structure templates and entity diagrams. Confirm roles, ownership, and program-specific requirements before drafting documents.\n\n## Pitfall #3: Failure to monitor ongoing compliance\n\nCompliance is not a one-time event at closing — it's a multi-year obligation.\n\n**Solution:**  \nImplement automated compliance workflows, calendar-based alerts for reports, and standardized monitoring packages for borrowers and projects.\n\n## Pitfall #4: Misclassification of expenditures\n\nQRE vs. non-QRE, eligible basis, or QALICB qualification errors are common and can be expensive.\n\n**Solution:**  \nUse clear categorization tools, shared cost ledgers, and real-time validation checks tied to program rules.\n\n## Pitfall #5: Poor communication between stakeholders\n\nDevelopers, CDEs, investors, and lenders often operate in silos and assume shared understanding that doesn't exist.\n\n**Solution:**  \nAdopt shared dashboards, transparent workflows, and standard reporting packages that keep every party aligned on status and risk.\n\n## How tCredex helps\n\ntCredex reduces compliance risk by:\n\n- **Standardizing documentation** across programs and deals\n- **Automating workflows** tied to each program's lifecycle\n- **Providing real-time validation** against practitioner-built rules\n- **Creating a shared source of truth** for all stakeholders\n\nCompliance doesn't have to be a pain point — with the right infrastructure, it becomes a competitive advantage."}
