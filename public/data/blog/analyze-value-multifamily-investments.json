Fundamental Metrics\r\n\r\n### Net Operating Income (NOI)\r\n\r\n**Formula:** NOI = Effective Gross Income − Operating Expenses\r\n\r\nNOI tells you how much income a property generates after accounting for all operating expenses but before financing costs. Effective Gross Income includes rental revenue plus ancillary income (pet fees, parking), minus vacancies and bad debt.\r\n\r\n### Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)\r\n\r\n**Formula:** Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value\r\n\r\nA property generating $300,000 NOI valued at 10% cap rate equals $3,000,000. Small shifts in Cap Rate can have a dramatic impact on value:\r\n\r\n| NOI | Cap Rate | Property Value |\r\n|-----|----------|----------------|\r\n| $300,000 | 8% | $3,750,000 |\r\n| $300,000 | 10% | $3,000,000 |\r\n| $300,000 | 12% | $2,500,000 |\r\n\r\n### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)\r\n\r\n**Formula:** DSCR = NOI / Debt Service\r\n\r\nA DSCR of 1.25 indicates $1.25 of income for every $1.00 of debt obligations. Lenders typically require minimum DSCRs of 1.20-1.35 depending on property type and risk.\r\n\r\n## II. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\r\n\r\nThe DCF approach projects future cash flows and terminal value, discounting them to present value.\r\n\r\n### Example Calculation\r\n\r\n**Assumptions:**\r\n- Initial NOI: $300,000\r\n- Annual Growth: 3%\r\n- Discount Rate: 8%\r\n- Hold Period: 10 years\r\n- Exit Cap Rate: 6%\r\n\r\n**Year-by-Year Cash Flows:**\r\n\r\n| Year | NOI | Present Value |\r\n|------|-----|---------------|\r\n| 1 | $300,000 | $277,778 |\r\n| 2 | $309,000 | $264,918 |\r\n| 3 | $318,270 | $252,656 |\r\n| ... | ... | ... |\r\n| 10 | $391,638 | $181,371 |\r\n\r\n**Terminal Value:** Year 10 NOI × (1 + growth) / Exit Cap Rate\r\n\r\n**Total Present Value:** ~$5.3 million\r\n\r\n## III. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\r\n\r\nIRR represents the annualized return where NPV equals zero, enabling investment comparison across different opportunities.\r\n\r\n### IRR vs. Other Metrics\r\n\r\n- **Cash-on-Cash Return:** Annual cash flow / equity invested\r\n- **Equity Multiple:** Total distributions / equity invested\r\n- **IRR:** Time-weighted return accounting for when cash flows occur\r\n\r\nIRR favors investments returning capital quickly, while equity multiple favors total returns regardless of timing.\r\n\r\n## IV. Capital Structure\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the capital stack is essential for analyzing risk and return.\r\n\r\n### Capital Stack Hierarchy (Highest Risk to Lowest)\r\n\r\n1. **Common Equity:** Highest risk, highest potential return\r\n2. **Preferred Equity:** Priority over common equity, fixed returns\r\n3. **Mezzanine Debt:** Subordinate to senior debt, higher rates\r\n4. **Senior Debt:** Lowest risk, secured by property\r\n\r\n### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\r\n\r\nWACC represents the blended cost of all capital sources:\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n- Senior Debt (60% of stack): 5% interest\r\n- Equity (40% of stack): 15% required return\r\n\r\n**WACC:** (0.60 × 5%) + (0.40 × 15%) = 9%\r\n\r\n## V. Common Pitfalls\r\n\r\n### Overestimating Growth\r\n\r\nAggressive rent growth assumptions inflate valuations. Use conservative, market-supported projections.\r\n\r\n### Underestimating Expenses\r\n\r\nCommon oversights include:\r\n- Capital expenditure reserves\r\n- Property management fees\r\n- Insurance increases\r\n- Property tax reassessment\r\n\r\n### Ignoring Market Risks\r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n- Local employment trends\r\n- New construction pipeline\r\n- Demographic shifts\r\n- Regulatory changes\r\n\r\n### Neglecting Refinancing Risk\r\n\r\nInterest rates change. Model scenarios where refinancing occurs at higher rates than current debt.\r\n\r\n### Disregarding Interest Rate Impact\r\n\r\nRising rates affect both:\r\n- Debt service costs\r\n- Cap rates (and thus property values)\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nSuccessful multifamily analysis requires understanding fundamental metrics, applying appropriate valuation models, and recognizing the limitations of each approach.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways:\r\n- NOI is the foundation of all valuation methods\r\n- Small cap rate changes create large value swings\r\n- DCF captures growth and timing; cap rates provide quick comparisons\r\n- IRR enables comparison across investments\r\n- Conservative assumptions protect against downside risk\r\n\r\nMaster these concepts to make informed investment decisions in multifamily real estate."}
