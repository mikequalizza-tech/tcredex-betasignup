Fundamental Metrics\n\n### Net Operating Income (NOI)\n\n**Formula:** NOI = Effective Gross Income − Operating Expenses\n\nNOI tells you how much income a property generates after accounting for all operating expenses but before financing costs. Effective Gross Income includes rental revenue plus ancillary income (pet fees, parking), minus vacancies and bad debt.\n\n### Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)\n\n**Formula:** Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value\n\nA property generating $300,000 NOI valued at 10% cap rate equals $3,000,000. Small shifts in Cap Rate can have a dramatic impact on value:\n\n| NOI | Cap Rate | Property Value |\n|-----|----------|----------------|\n| $300,000 | 8% | $3,750,000 |\n| $300,000 | 10% | $3,000,000 |\n| $300,000 | 12% | $2,500,000 |\n\n### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)\n\n**Formula:** DSCR = NOI / Debt Service\n\nA DSCR of 1.25 indicates $1.25 of income for every $1.00 of debt obligations. Lenders typically require minimum DSCRs of 1.20-1.35 depending on property type and risk.\n\n## II. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\n\nThe DCF approach projects future cash flows and terminal value, discounting them to present value.\n\n### Example Calculation\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Initial NOI: $300,000\n- Annual Growth: 3%\n- Discount Rate: 8%\n- Hold Period: 10 years\n- Exit Cap Rate: 6%\n\n**Year-by-Year Cash Flows:**\n\n| Year | NOI | Present Value |\n|------|-----|---------------|\n| 1 | $300,000 | $277,778 |\n| 2 | $309,000 | $264,918 |\n| 3 | $318,270 | $252,656 |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n| 10 | $391,638 | $181,371 |\n\n**Terminal Value:** Year 10 NOI × (1 + growth) / Exit Cap Rate\n\n**Total Present Value:** ~$5.3 million\n\n## III. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n\nIRR represents the annualized return where NPV equals zero, enabling investment comparison across different opportunities.\n\n### IRR vs. Other Metrics\n\n- **Cash-on-Cash Return:** Annual cash flow / equity invested\n- **Equity Multiple:** Total distributions / equity invested\n- **IRR:** Time-weighted return accounting for when cash flows occur\n\nIRR favors investments returning capital quickly, while equity multiple favors total returns regardless of timing.\n\n## IV. Capital Structure\n\nUnderstanding the capital stack is essential for analyzing risk and return.\n\n### Capital Stack Hierarchy (Highest Risk to Lowest)\n\n1. **Common Equity:** Highest risk, highest potential return\n2. **Preferred Equity:** Priority over common equity, fixed returns\n3. **Mezzanine Debt:** Subordinate to senior debt, higher rates\n4. **Senior Debt:** Lowest risk, secured by property\n\n### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nWACC represents the blended cost of all capital sources:\n\n**Example:**\n- Senior Debt (60% of stack): 5% interest\n- Equity (40% of stack): 15% required return\n\n**WACC:** (0.60 × 5%) + (0.40 × 15%) = 9%\n\n## V. Common Pitfalls\n\n### Overestimating Growth\n\nAggressive rent growth assumptions inflate valuations. Use conservative, market-supported projections.\n\n### Underestimating Expenses\n\nCommon oversights include:\n- Capital expenditure reserves\n- Property management fees\n- Insurance increases\n- Property tax reassessment\n\n### Ignoring Market Risks\n\nConsider:\n- Local employment trends\n- New construction pipeline\n- Demographic shifts\n- Regulatory changes\n\n### Neglecting Refinancing Risk\n\nInterest rates change. Model scenarios where refinancing occurs at higher rates than current debt.\n\n### Disregarding Interest Rate Impact\n\nRising rates affect both:\n- Debt service costs\n- Cap rates (and thus property values)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSuccessful multifamily analysis requires understanding fundamental metrics, applying appropriate valuation models, and recognizing the limitations of each approach.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- NOI is the foundation of all valuation methods\n- Small cap rate changes create large value swings\n- DCF captures growth and timing; cap rates provide quick comparisons\n- IRR enables comparison across investments\n- Conservative assumptions protect against downside risk\n\nMaster these concepts to make informed investment decisions in multifamily real estate."}
