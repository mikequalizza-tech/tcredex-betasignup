The HTC/NMTC master lease model is the most widely used approach for twinned deals.\n\n## Why use a master lease structure?\n\nThe master lease structure allows:\n\n- HTC investors to claim credits through a lessee entity\n- NMTC investors to participate through a leverage structure\n- Separation of ownership and operations\n- Flexibility in allocating QREs and QLICI proceeds\n\nIt's a structure born from necessity — aligning two programs with different rules, timelines, and compliance frameworks.\n\n## Core components\n\n### 1. Property owner (fee owner)\n\nHolds title to the historic building and performs the rehabilitation.\n\n### 2. Master tenant (lessee)\n\nLeases the property from the owner and claims the HTC, subject to program rules and ownership tests.\n\n### 3. NMTC structure\n\nTypically includes:\n\n- A **leverage lender** providing debt into the NMTC investment fund\n- An **investment fund** receiving equity from the NMTC investor\n- One or more **CDEs** making QLICIs\n- A **QALICB**, often the master tenant or a related entity\n\n### 4. QRE allocation\n\nQualified Rehabilitation Expenditures must be properly allocated to the master tenant so that entity can validly claim the HTC.\n\n### 5. Compliance periods\n\n- HTC: 5-year recapture period\n- NMTC: 7-year compliance period\n\nThe structure must survive both without tripping recapture.\n\n## Common challenges\n\n- Aligning QRE timing with NMTC disbursements and placed-in-service dates\n- Managing related-party rules between owner, master tenant, and QALICB\n- Ensuring the master tenant is a valid HTC claimant\n- Coordinating exit strategies that work for both HTC and NMTC investors\n\n## How tCredex helps\n\ntCredex simplifies HTC/NMTC master lease deals by:\n\n- **Providing pre-built structure templates** and entity diagrams\n- **Automating QRE/QALICB alignment** and tracking\n- **Generating documentation** tailored to both credit programs\n- **Tracking compliance** across overlapping 5- and 7-year periods\n\nMaster lease structures are complex — but with the right tools, they become manageable, teachable, and repeatable."}
