It provides a 20% federal tax credit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures (QREs) on certified historic structures.\r\n\r\n## How HTC works\r\n\r\nTo qualify, a project must meet three core requirements:\r\n\r\n1. **Certified historic structure**  \r\n   Listed individually on the National Register or contributing to a registered district.\r\n\r\n2. **Substantial rehabilitation test**  \r\n   Qualified rehabilitation expenditures must exceed the building's adjusted basis.\r\n\r\n3. **Secretary of the Interior standards**  \r\n   Rehabilitation must preserve the building's historic character.\r\n\r\n## Why HTC matters\r\n\r\n- **Revitalizes aging urban infrastructure** by turning obsolete buildings into productive assets\r\n- **Supports adaptive reuse** instead of demolition\r\n- **Attracts private capital** into challenging locations\r\n- **Creates jobs and anchors community redevelopment** through new tenants and uses\r\n\r\n## Common challenges\r\n\r\n- Managing the Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 application and approval process\r\n- Allocating costs correctly between QREs and non‑QREs\r\n- Structuring twinned HTC + NMTC deals where both programs have distinct rules\r\n- Timing construction draws, placed‑in‑service dates, and compliance periods\r\n\r\n## How tCredex helps\r\n\r\ntCredex simplifies HTC structuring by:\r\n\r\n- **Standardizing QRE tracking** across contractors and cost categories\r\n- **Supporting twinned credit structures** with templates for HTC + NMTC and HTC + LIHTC\r\n- **Automating documentation** for investors and advisors\r\n- **Providing compliance workflows** around Part 1–3 and the 5‑year recapture period\r\n\r\nHTC deals are complex — but with the right tools, they become powerful catalysts for community transformation instead of one‑off headaches."}
