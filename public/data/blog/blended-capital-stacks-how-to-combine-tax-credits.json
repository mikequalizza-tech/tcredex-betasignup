Blended capital stacks allow developers to combine multiple tax-credit programs to close financing gaps and strengthen project feasibility.\r\n\r\n## Why blend credits?\r\n\r\n- **Maximize available subsidy** by layering compatible programs\r\n- **Reduce reliance on debt** and soften coverage constraints\r\n- **Improve project viability** in locations or uses the market struggles to support alone\r\n- **Support catalytic outcomes** like mixed-use hubs, cultural facilities, or specialized services\r\n\r\n## Common blended structures\r\n\r\n### NMTC + HTC\r\n\r\nIdeal for historic commercial buildings in distressed areas.  \r\nHTC supports the rehabilitation of the historic asset, while NMTC brings additional subsidy for community-serving uses.\r\n\r\n### LIHTC + HTC\r\n\r\nUsed for adaptive reuse of historic buildings into affordable housing.  \r\nHTC covers historic rehab costs while LIHTC drives the housing feasibility.\r\n\r\n### NMTC + OZ\r\n\r\nCombines OZ equity with NMTC leverage structures.  \r\nOZ capital can provide part of the leverage loan or sponsor equity, with NMTC delivering additional subsidy.\r\n\r\n### LIHTC + NMTC + HTC\r\n\r\nOne of the most complex but powerful combinations for mixed-use redevelopment where housing, commercial, and community uses coexist in or around a historic structure.\r\n\r\n## Challenges in blended deals\r\n\r\n- **Conflicting compliance periods** (5-year HTC, 7-year NMTC, 15-year LIHTC, 10-year OZ hold)\r\n- **Entity layering** that must satisfy multiple regimes simultaneously\r\n- **Alignment of QRE, QALICB, and QOZB rules**\r\n- **Documentation complexity** across multiple investor groups and advisors\r\n- **Exit strategies** that must work across different timelines and expectations\r\n\r\n## How tCredex helps\r\n\r\ntCredex provides:\r\n\r\n- **Pre-built blended structure templates** for common combinations\r\n- **Automated documentation** tailored to each program\r\n- **Compliance workflows** that track overlapping timelines\r\n- **Capital stack modeling tools** that show how each layer interacts\r\n\r\nBlended deals are complex — but they unlock transformative impact when executed with discipline, data, and repeatable structure."}
