Blended capital stacks allow developers to combine multiple tax-credit programs to close financing gaps and strengthen project feasibility.\n\n## Why blend credits?\n\n- **Maximize available subsidy** by layering compatible programs\n- **Reduce reliance on debt** and soften coverage constraints\n- **Improve project viability** in locations or uses the market struggles to support alone\n- **Support catalytic outcomes** like mixed-use hubs, cultural facilities, or specialized services\n\n## Common blended structures\n\n### NMTC + HTC\n\nIdeal for historic commercial buildings in distressed areas.  \nHTC supports the rehabilitation of the historic asset, while NMTC brings additional subsidy for community-serving uses.\n\n### LIHTC + HTC\n\nUsed for adaptive reuse of historic buildings into affordable housing.  \nHTC covers historic rehab costs while LIHTC drives the housing feasibility.\n\n### NMTC + OZ\n\nCombines OZ equity with NMTC leverage structures.  \nOZ capital can provide part of the leverage loan or sponsor equity, with NMTC delivering additional subsidy.\n\n### LIHTC + NMTC + HTC\n\nOne of the most complex but powerful combinations for mixed-use redevelopment where housing, commercial, and community uses coexist in or around a historic structure.\n\n## Challenges in blended deals\n\n- **Conflicting compliance periods** (5-year HTC, 7-year NMTC, 15-year LIHTC, 10-year OZ hold)\n- **Entity layering** that must satisfy multiple regimes simultaneously\n- **Alignment of QRE, QALICB, and QOZB rules**\n- **Documentation complexity** across multiple investor groups and advisors\n- **Exit strategies** that must work across different timelines and expectations\n\n## How tCredex helps\n\ntCredex provides:\n\n- **Pre-built blended structure templates** for common combinations\n- **Automated documentation** tailored to each program\n- **Compliance workflows** that track overlapping timelines\n- **Capital stack modeling tools** that show how each layer interacts\n\nBlended deals are complex — but they unlock transformative impact when executed with discipline, data, and repeatable structure."}
