LIHTC teams use one set of tools. NMTC teams use another. HTC, OZ, and state credit practitioners rely on spreadsheets, PDFs, and institutional memory.\r\n\r\ntCredex changes that.\r\n\r\n## The five programs tCredex supports\r\n\r\n### 1. Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)\r\n\r\nStandardized underwriting, eligible basis modeling, and investor documentation to support affordable housing transactions.\r\n\r\n### 2. New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC)\r\n\r\nGuided leverage structures, compliance workflows, and QALICB validation for community and economic development projects.\r\n\r\n### 3. Historic Tax Credits (HTC)\r\n\r\nQRE tracking, Part 1–3 documentation support, and twinned structure templates for HTC + NMTC and HTC + LIHTC.\r\n\r\n### 4. Opportunity Zones (OZ)\r\n\r\nAsset-test tracking, QOZB structuring, and investor reporting for long-term equity in distressed communities.\r\n\r\n### 5. State Tax Credits\r\n\r\nModeling, compliance, and documentation for state-level programs across the country, including transferability workflows.\r\n\r\n## Why a unified platform matters\r\n\r\nFor the first time, practitioners can:\r\n\r\n- **Build blended capital stacks** without recreating structures from scratch\r\n- **Standardize documentation** across programs, deals, and teams\r\n- **Reduce compliance risk** with practitioner-built rules baked into workflows\r\n- **Accelerate deal timelines** by cutting friction out of closing\r\n- **Operate from a single source of truth** instead of scattered files and emails\r\n\r\n## Built by practitioners, not outsiders\r\n\r\ntCredex is informed by decades of experience — including CDE operations, multiple allocation awards, and billions syndicated. The platform encodes what seasoned practitioners already know and brings that discipline to every deal.\r\n\r\n## The future of tax-credit finance\r\n\r\ntCredex is more than software.  \r\nIt's the missing infrastructure for a fragmented industry — a shared operating system for tax-credit finance."}
