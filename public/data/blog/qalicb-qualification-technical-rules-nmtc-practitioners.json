If the operating entity fails this test, the entire structure is at risk.\n\n## The five core tests\n\n### 1. Gross income test\n\nAt least 50% of gross income must be derived from activities in a Low-Income Community (LIC).\n\n### 2. Tangible property test\n\nAt least 40% of the tangible property must be located in an LIC.\n\n### 3. Services performed test\n\nAt least 40% of services must be performed in an LIC, often measured by payroll or hours.\n\n### 4. Collectibles restriction\n\nNo more than 5% of property can be collectibles, such as art or similar assets.\n\n### 5. Nonqualified financial property (NQFP)\n\nNo more than 5% of assets can be NQFP, such as certain financial instruments and excess cash.\n\n## Common pitfalls\n\n- Misclassifying revenue sources between LIC and non-LIC activities\n- Incorrectly allocating property across locations or facilities\n- Failing to track service hours or payroll by geography\n- Holding excess cash or financial instruments beyond allowed limits\n\n## Why QALICB qualification is hard\n\n- Multi-entity ownership and operating structures\n- Businesses with multiple locations, some in and some out of LICs\n- Construction and start-up periods where revenue is limited or evolving\n- Blended NMTC + HTC or OZ deals where multiple regimes interact\n\n## How tCredex helps\n\ntCredex supports QALICB compliance by:\n\n- **Automating QALICB testing** against the five core standards\n- **Providing real-time compliance alerts** as project data changes\n- **Standardizing data collection** from borrowers and operators\n- **Embedding practitioner-built logic** into workflows and dashboards\n\nQALICB qualification is technical — but with the right infrastructure, it becomes predictable instead of mysterious."}
