Sponsors (Developers & Nonprofits)\r\n\r\n**Who they are:** Developers, nonprofits, and community organizations seeking tax credit financing for their projects.\r\n\r\n**What they do on tCredex:**\r\n- Submit projects through the Intake Form\r\n- Generate DealCards visible on the Marketplace\r\n- Receive matches from CDEs and Investors\r\n- Enter the Closing Room for due diligence\r\n- Upload documents and respond to requests\r\n\r\n**Their journey:**\r\n```\r\nIntake Form → DealCard → Marketplace → Match → Closing Room → Close\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key insight:** Sponsors are the deal originators. Every transaction starts with a Sponsor submitting a project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. CDEs (Community Development Entities)\r\n\r\n**Who they are:** Certified intermediaries that receive NMTC allocation from the CDFI Fund and deploy it to qualified projects.\r\n\r\n**What they do on tCredex:**\r\n- Set deployment preferences (geography, sectors, deal size)\r\n- Browse and receive matched projects\r\n- Evaluate DealCards and request information\r\n- Issue Letters of Intent (LOIs)\r\n- Manage allocation tracking and deployment deadlines\r\n\r\n**Their journey:**\r\n```\r\nSet Preferences → Receive Matches → Evaluate → Issue LOI → Closing Room → Deploy\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key insight:** CDEs are ONLY involved in NMTC deals. Other programs (LIHTC, HTC, OZ) go directly from Sponsor to Investor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Investors (Banks, Insurance, Funds)\r\n\r\n**Who they are:** Financial institutions that purchase tax credits in exchange for equity investment.\r\n\r\n**What they do on tCredex:**\r\n- Set investment criteria (credit types, size, geography)\r\n- Browse opportunities across all programs\r\n- Evaluate deals for underwriting\r\n- Issue commitment letters\r\n- Track portfolio and compliance\r\n\r\n**Their journey:**\r\n```\r\nSet Criteria → Receive Matches → Evaluate → Commit → Closing Room → Fund\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key insight:** Investors participate in ALL credit programs. For NMTC, they work with CDEs. For other programs, they work directly with Sponsors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Admins (Platform Operators)\r\n\r\n**Who they are:** tCredex platform administrators.\r\n\r\n**What they do:**\r\n- Monitor platform activity\r\n- Verify organizations\r\n- Manage compliance\r\n- Provide support\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How Roles Connect\r\n\r\n### NMTC Deals (CDE Required)\r\n\r\n```\r\nSPONSOR → CDE → INVESTOR\r\n   │        │        │\r\n   │        │        └── Purchases credits, provides equity\r\n   │        └── Allocates NMTC, structures deal\r\n   └── Originates project, seeks financing\r\n```\r\n\r\n### All Other Programs (Direct to Investor)\r\n\r\n```\r\nSPONSOR → INVESTOR\r\n   │           │\r\n   │           └── Purchases credits, provides equity\r\n   └── Originates project, seeks financing\r\n```\r\n\r\n**LIHTC, HTC, OZ, State Credits** all flow directly from Sponsor to Investor without CDE intermediary.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Program Routing Logic\r\n\r\n| Program | Route |\r\n|---------|-------|\r\n| NMTC | Sponsor → CDE → Investor |\r\n| LIHTC | Sponsor → Investor |\r\n| HTC | Sponsor → Investor |\r\n| OZ | Sponsor → Investor |\r\n| State Credits | Sponsor → Investor |\r\n\r\n**Stacked Deals:** When a project uses multiple programs (e.g., HTC + NMTC), the Sponsor works with BOTH CDEs (for NMTC) AND Investors (for HTC).\r\n\r\n**Important:** LIHTC and NMTC can NEVER be combined on the same project due to conflicting compliance requirements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Teams Within Organizations\r\n\r\nEach organization can have multiple team members with different roles:\r\n\r\n### Organization Roles\r\n\r\n| Role | Permissions |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| **Admin** | Full access, can invite members, manage settings |\r\n| **Member** | Can view and work on deals, upload documents |\r\n| **Viewer** | Read-only access to deals and documents |\r\n\r\n### Inviting Team Members\r\n\r\n1. Go to **Settings → Team**\r\n2. Click **Invite Member**\r\n3. Enter email and select role\r\n4. Team member receives invitation\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\nOrganizations go through verification to build trust:\r\n\r\n- **Unverified** - New account, limited visibility\r\n- **Verified** - Identity confirmed, full marketplace access\r\n\r\nCDEs must provide certification numbers. Investors may need accreditation verification.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Need Help?\r\n\r\nContact **support@tcredex.com** for assistance with your account."}
