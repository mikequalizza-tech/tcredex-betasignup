Sponsors (Developers & Nonprofits)\n\n**Who they are:** Developers, nonprofits, and community organizations seeking tax credit financing for their projects.\n\n**What they do on tCredex:**\n- Submit projects through the Intake Form\n- Generate DealCards visible on the Marketplace\n- Receive matches from CDEs and Investors\n- Enter the Closing Room for due diligence\n- Upload documents and respond to requests\n\n**Their journey:**\n```\nIntake Form → DealCard → Marketplace → Match → Closing Room → Close\n```\n\n**Key insight:** Sponsors are the deal originators. Every transaction starts with a Sponsor submitting a project.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CDEs (Community Development Entities)\n\n**Who they are:** Certified intermediaries that receive NMTC allocation from the CDFI Fund and deploy it to qualified projects.\n\n**What they do on tCredex:**\n- Set deployment preferences (geography, sectors, deal size)\n- Browse and receive matched projects\n- Evaluate DealCards and request information\n- Issue Letters of Intent (LOIs)\n- Manage allocation tracking and deployment deadlines\n\n**Their journey:**\n```\nSet Preferences → Receive Matches → Evaluate → Issue LOI → Closing Room → Deploy\n```\n\n**Key insight:** CDEs are ONLY involved in NMTC deals. Other programs (LIHTC, HTC, OZ) go directly from Sponsor to Investor.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Investors (Banks, Insurance, Funds)\n\n**Who they are:** Financial institutions that purchase tax credits in exchange for equity investment.\n\n**What they do on tCredex:**\n- Set investment criteria (credit types, size, geography)\n- Browse opportunities across all programs\n- Evaluate deals for underwriting\n- Issue commitment letters\n- Track portfolio and compliance\n\n**Their journey:**\n```\nSet Criteria → Receive Matches → Evaluate → Commit → Closing Room → Fund\n```\n\n**Key insight:** Investors participate in ALL credit programs. For NMTC, they work with CDEs. For other programs, they work directly with Sponsors.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Admins (Platform Operators)\n\n**Who they are:** tCredex platform administrators.\n\n**What they do:**\n- Monitor platform activity\n- Verify organizations\n- Manage compliance\n- Provide support\n\n---\n\n## How Roles Connect\n\n### NMTC Deals (CDE Required)\n\n```\nSPONSOR → CDE → INVESTOR\n   │        │        │\n   │        │        └── Purchases credits, provides equity\n   │        └── Allocates NMTC, structures deal\n   └── Originates project, seeks financing\n```\n\n### All Other Programs (Direct to Investor)\n\n```\nSPONSOR → INVESTOR\n   │           │\n   │           └── Purchases credits, provides equity\n   └── Originates project, seeks financing\n```\n\n**LIHTC, HTC, OZ, State Credits** all flow directly from Sponsor to Investor without CDE intermediary.\n\n---\n\n## Program Routing Logic\n\n| Program | Route |\n|---------|-------|\n| NMTC | Sponsor → CDE → Investor |\n| LIHTC | Sponsor → Investor |\n| HTC | Sponsor → Investor |\n| OZ | Sponsor → Investor |\n| State Credits | Sponsor → Investor |\n\n**Stacked Deals:** When a project uses multiple programs (e.g., HTC + NMTC), the Sponsor works with BOTH CDEs (for NMTC) AND Investors (for HTC).\n\n**Important:** LIHTC and NMTC can NEVER be combined on the same project due to conflicting compliance requirements.\n\n---\n\n## Teams Within Organizations\n\nEach organization can have multiple team members with different roles:\n\n### Organization Roles\n\n| Role | Permissions |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Admin** | Full access, can invite members, manage settings |\n| **Member** | Can view and work on deals, upload documents |\n| **Viewer** | Read-only access to deals and documents |\n\n### Inviting Team Members\n\n1. Go to **Settings → Team**\n2. Click **Invite Member**\n3. Enter email and select role\n4. Team member receives invitation\n\n---\n\n## Verification\n\nOrganizations go through verification to build trust:\n\n- **Unverified** - New account, limited visibility\n- **Verified** - Identity confirmed, full marketplace access\n\nCDEs must provide certification numbers. Investors may need accreditation verification.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help?\n\nContact **support@tcredex.com** for assistance with your account."}
