Profile Analysis\r\n\r\nAutoMatch reads your profile and preferences:\r\n\r\n**For Sponsors:**\r\n- Project location and census tract\r\n- Program eligibility (NMTC, LIHTC, HTC, OZ)\r\n- Financing needs and timeline\r\n- Community impact metrics\r\n\r\n**For CDEs:**\r\n- Geographic focus areas\r\n- Target sectors and deal sizes\r\n- Distress requirements\r\n- Deployment timeline\r\n\r\n**For Investors:**\r\n- Investment criteria and credit types\r\n- CRA assessment areas\r\n- Yield and size parameters\r\n- Sector preferences\r\n\r\n### 2. Matching Algorithm\r\n\r\nWhen a new project or profile enters the system, AutoMatch:\r\n\r\n1. Scans all relevant counterparties\r\n2. Scores each potential match\r\n3. Ranks by compatibility\r\n4. Surfaces top matches to both parties\r\n\r\n### 3. Match Notifications\r\n\r\nYou receive notifications when:\r\n\r\n- A new high-scoring match appears\r\n- A match moves to a new stage\r\n- Updated information improves match quality\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Match Scoring\r\n\r\nMatches receive a score based on alignment across key factors:\r\n\r\n| Factor | Weight | Example |\r\n|--------|--------|---------|\r\n| Geography | High | Project in CDE's target state |\r\n| Program | High | Credit type matches investor focus |\r\n| Deal Size | Medium | QLICI within CDE's range |\r\n| Sector | Medium | Healthcare matches CDE's priority |\r\n| Distress | Medium | Severely distressed tract |\r\n| Timeline | Low | Alignment on close date |\r\n\r\nHigher scores indicate stronger matches. Scores above 80 typically represent excellent fits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What Makes a Good Match\r\n\r\n### For Sponsors + CDEs\r\n\r\nStrong matches occur when:\r\n- Project is in CDE's target geography\r\n- QLICI request fits CDE's deal size range\r\n- Sector aligns with CDE's mission\r\n- Tract meets distress requirements\r\n- Timeline works for deployment deadline\r\n\r\n### For Sponsors + Investors\r\n\r\nStrong matches occur when:\r\n- Credit type matches investor focus\r\n- Geography aligns with CRA needs\r\n- Investment size fits investor parameters\r\n- Project quality meets underwriting standards\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Improving Your Matches\r\n\r\n### Keep Your Profile Updated\r\n\r\nOutdated preferences lead to poor matches. Review and update regularly.\r\n\r\n### Be Specific\r\n\r\nVague criteria produce broad, less useful results. Specific preferences drive better matches.\r\n\r\n### Complete Your DealCard\r\n\r\nFor sponsors: higher completion tiers generate better matches. Tier 3 projects attract more attention than Tier 1.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Match Actions\r\n\r\nWhen you receive a match, you can:\r\n\r\n- **View** the full DealCard or profile\r\n- **Save** to your pipeline for later review\r\n- **Express Interest** to signal intent\r\n- **Decline** to remove from your match list\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Behind the Scenes\r\n\r\nAutoMatch uses:\r\n\r\n- Census tract eligibility data\r\n- Real-time profile comparisons\r\n- Historical deal patterns\r\n- Preference weighting algorithms\r\n\r\nThe system improves over time as more deals close and feedback loops refine the model.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Need Help?\r\n\r\nContact **support@tcredex.com** for assistance."}
