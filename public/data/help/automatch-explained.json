Profile Analysis\n\nAutoMatch reads your profile and preferences:\n\n**For Sponsors:**\n- Project location and census tract\n- Program eligibility (NMTC, LIHTC, HTC, OZ)\n- Financing needs and timeline\n- Community impact metrics\n\n**For CDEs:**\n- Geographic focus areas\n- Target sectors and deal sizes\n- Distress requirements\n- Deployment timeline\n\n**For Investors:**\n- Investment criteria and credit types\n- CRA assessment areas\n- Yield and size parameters\n- Sector preferences\n\n### 2. Matching Algorithm\n\nWhen a new project or profile enters the system, AutoMatch:\n\n1. Scans all relevant counterparties\n2. Scores each potential match\n3. Ranks by compatibility\n4. Surfaces top matches to both parties\n\n### 3. Match Notifications\n\nYou receive notifications when:\n\n- A new high-scoring match appears\n- A match moves to a new stage\n- Updated information improves match quality\n\n---\n\n## Match Scoring\n\nMatches receive a score based on alignment across key factors:\n\n| Factor | Weight | Example |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| Geography | High | Project in CDE's target state |\n| Program | High | Credit type matches investor focus |\n| Deal Size | Medium | QLICI within CDE's range |\n| Sector | Medium | Healthcare matches CDE's priority |\n| Distress | Medium | Severely distressed tract |\n| Timeline | Low | Alignment on close date |\n\nHigher scores indicate stronger matches. Scores above 80 typically represent excellent fits.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes a Good Match\n\n### For Sponsors + CDEs\n\nStrong matches occur when:\n- Project is in CDE's target geography\n- QLICI request fits CDE's deal size range\n- Sector aligns with CDE's mission\n- Tract meets distress requirements\n- Timeline works for deployment deadline\n\n### For Sponsors + Investors\n\nStrong matches occur when:\n- Credit type matches investor focus\n- Geography aligns with CRA needs\n- Investment size fits investor parameters\n- Project quality meets underwriting standards\n\n---\n\n## Improving Your Matches\n\n### Keep Your Profile Updated\n\nOutdated preferences lead to poor matches. Review and update regularly.\n\n### Be Specific\n\nVague criteria produce broad, less useful results. Specific preferences drive better matches.\n\n### Complete Your DealCard\n\nFor sponsors: higher completion tiers generate better matches. Tier 3 projects attract more attention than Tier 1.\n\n---\n\n## Match Actions\n\nWhen you receive a match, you can:\n\n- **View** the full DealCard or profile\n- **Save** to your pipeline for later review\n- **Express Interest** to signal intent\n- **Decline** to remove from your match list\n\n---\n\n## Behind the Scenes\n\nAutoMatch uses:\n\n- Census tract eligibility data\n- Real-time profile comparisons\n- Historical deal patterns\n- Preference weighting algorithms\n\nThe system improves over time as more deals close and feedback loops refine the model.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help?\n\nContact **support@tcredex.com** for assistance."}
