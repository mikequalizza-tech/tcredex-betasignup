Every eligibility determination, every match score, and every compliance check traces back to the map.\n\n---\n\n## What the Map Shows\n\n### Census Tract Eligibility\n\nEvery census tract in the United States is classified:\n\n| Layer | What It Shows |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **NMTC Eligible** | Tracts qualifying for New Markets Tax Credits |\n| **Severely Distressed** | High-priority NMTC tracts with deeper need |\n| **Opportunity Zones** | Designated OZ tracts for capital gains benefits |\n| **QCT (Qualified Census Tracts)** | LIHTC bonus areas |\n| **State Programs** | State-specific tax credit eligibility |\n\n### Distress Indicators\n\nEach tract displays:\n- **Poverty Rate** - Percentage below poverty line\n- **Median Family Income** - As % of area median\n- **Unemployment Rate** - Local jobless rate\n- **Classification** - Urban, rural, tribal\n\n---\n\n## How the Map Drives the System\n\n### 1. Address Lookup → Instant Eligibility\n\nWhen a Sponsor enters a project address:\n\n1. System geocodes the address to coordinates\n2. Coordinates map to a census tract (GEOID)\n3. Tract data returns eligibility for ALL programs\n4. DealCard auto-populates with tract information\n\n**No manual eligibility research needed.** The map tells you instantly what programs your project qualifies for.\n\n### 2. Tract Data → Match Scoring\n\nAutoMatch uses tract data to score matches:\n\n- CDE prefers severely distressed tracts? Projects in those tracts score higher.\n- Investor focuses on Opportunity Zones? OZ-eligible projects surface first.\n- State program available? System flags state credit opportunities.\n\n### 3. Map Exploration → Deal Discovery\n\nCDEs and Investors can:\n\n- Browse the map to find eligible areas\n- Filter by distress level, program, or state\n- Click tracts to see active projects\n- Identify underserved markets with allocation need\n\n---\n\n## Eligibility Layers Explained\n\n### NMTC Eligibility\n\nA tract qualifies for NMTC if it meets ANY of these:\n- Poverty rate ≥ 20%\n- Median income ≤ 80% of area median\n- Unemployment ≥ 1.5x national average\n\n**Severely Distressed** tracts have even deeper indicators—CDEs often prioritize these.\n\n### Opportunity Zones\n\nDesignated by governors in 2018, OZ tracts offer:\n- Capital gains deferral\n- Step-up in basis after 5/7 years\n- Tax-free appreciation after 10 years\n\n### Qualified Census Tracts (QCT)\n\nFor LIHTC, QCTs provide:\n- 30% basis boost for 9% and 4% deals\n- Higher credit value per unit\n\n### State Programs\n\nEach state has unique programs with their own eligible areas. The map shows:\n- State NMTC programs\n- State HTC programs\n- Brownfield incentives\n- Other state-specific credits\n\n---\n\n## Using the Map\n\n### Basic Navigation\n\n- **Zoom** - Scroll or pinch to zoom in/out\n- **Pan** - Click and drag to move\n- **Click** - Select a tract to see details\n- **Search** - Enter address to jump to location\n\n### Layer Controls\n\nToggle layers on/off to see:\n- NMTC eligibility\n- Severely distressed\n- Opportunity Zones\n- QCTs\n- State programs\n\n### Tract Details Panel\n\nClicking a tract shows:\n- GEOID (census tract number)\n- County and state\n- All eligibility flags\n- Distress metrics\n- Active projects in that tract\n\n---\n\n## Data Sources\n\nThe map aggregates authoritative federal data:\n\n| Data | Source | Update Frequency |\n|------|--------|------------------|\n| Census Tracts | US Census Bureau | Decennial |\n| NMTC Eligibility | CDFI Fund | Annual |\n| Opportunity Zones | IRS | Fixed (2018) |\n| QCTs/DDAs | HUD | Annual |\n| Poverty/Income | ACS 5-Year | Annual |\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### For Sponsors\n\n- Know instantly if your project qualifies\n- See ALL available programs in one view\n- No more manual tract research\n\n### For CDEs\n\n- Find projects in your target areas\n- Verify eligibility before engagement\n- Track deployment geography\n\n### For Investors\n\n- Filter opportunities by location criteria\n- Verify CRA eligibility\n- Map portfolio geography\n\n---\n\n## The Map is the Source of Truth\n\nEvery data point flows from the map:\n\n```\nMAP DATA\n   │\n   ├── Intake Form (auto-populates eligibility)\n   │\n   ├── DealCard (displays tract info)\n   │\n   ├── AutoMatch (scores geographic fit)\n   │\n   └── Compliance (verifies requirements)\n```\n\nWhen the map says a tract is eligible, the system treats it as eligible. When the map shows distress metrics, those drive scoring. The map is not decorative—it's authoritative.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help?\n\nContact **support@tcredex.com** for map assistance."}
