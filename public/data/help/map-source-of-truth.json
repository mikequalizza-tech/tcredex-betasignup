Every eligibility determination, every match score, and every compliance check traces back to the map.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What the Map Shows\r\n\r\n### Census Tract Eligibility\r\n\r\nEvery census tract in the United States is classified:\r\n\r\n| Layer | What It Shows |\r\n|-------|---------------|\r\n| **NMTC Eligible** | Tracts qualifying for New Markets Tax Credits |\r\n| **Severely Distressed** | High-priority NMTC tracts with deeper need |\r\n| **Opportunity Zones** | Designated OZ tracts for capital gains benefits |\r\n| **QCT (Qualified Census Tracts)** | LIHTC bonus areas |\r\n| **State Programs** | State-specific tax credit eligibility |\r\n\r\n### Distress Indicators\r\n\r\nEach tract displays:\r\n- **Poverty Rate** - Percentage below poverty line\r\n- **Median Family Income** - As % of area median\r\n- **Unemployment Rate** - Local jobless rate\r\n- **Classification** - Urban, rural, tribal\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How the Map Drives the System\r\n\r\n### 1. Address Lookup → Instant Eligibility\r\n\r\nWhen a Sponsor enters a project address:\r\n\r\n1. System geocodes the address to coordinates\r\n2. Coordinates map to a census tract (GEOID)\r\n3. Tract data returns eligibility for ALL programs\r\n4. DealCard auto-populates with tract information\r\n\r\n**No manual eligibility research needed.** The map tells you instantly what programs your project qualifies for.\r\n\r\n### 2. Tract Data → Match Scoring\r\n\r\nAutoMatch uses tract data to score matches:\r\n\r\n- CDE prefers severely distressed tracts? Projects in those tracts score higher.\r\n- Investor focuses on Opportunity Zones? OZ-eligible projects surface first.\r\n- State program available? System flags state credit opportunities.\r\n\r\n### 3. Map Exploration → Deal Discovery\r\n\r\nCDEs and Investors can:\r\n\r\n- Browse the map to find eligible areas\r\n- Filter by distress level, program, or state\r\n- Click tracts to see active projects\r\n- Identify underserved markets with allocation need\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Eligibility Layers Explained\r\n\r\n### NMTC Eligibility\r\n\r\nA tract qualifies for NMTC if it meets ANY of these:\r\n- Poverty rate ≥ 20%\r\n- Median income ≤ 80% of area median\r\n- Unemployment ≥ 1.5x national average\r\n\r\n**Severely Distressed** tracts have even deeper indicators—CDEs often prioritize these.\r\n\r\n### Opportunity Zones\r\n\r\nDesignated by governors in 2018, OZ tracts offer:\r\n- Capital gains deferral\r\n- Step-up in basis after 5/7 years\r\n- Tax-free appreciation after 10 years\r\n\r\n### Qualified Census Tracts (QCT)\r\n\r\nFor LIHTC, QCTs provide:\r\n- 30% basis boost for 9% and 4% deals\r\n- Higher credit value per unit\r\n\r\n### State Programs\r\n\r\nEach state has unique programs with their own eligible areas. The map shows:\r\n- State NMTC programs\r\n- State HTC programs\r\n- Brownfield incentives\r\n- Other state-specific credits\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Using the Map\r\n\r\n### Basic Navigation\r\n\r\n- **Zoom** - Scroll or pinch to zoom in/out\r\n- **Pan** - Click and drag to move\r\n- **Click** - Select a tract to see details\r\n- **Search** - Enter address to jump to location\r\n\r\n### Layer Controls\r\n\r\nToggle layers on/off to see:\r\n- NMTC eligibility\r\n- Severely distressed\r\n- Opportunity Zones\r\n- QCTs\r\n- State programs\r\n\r\n### Tract Details Panel\r\n\r\nClicking a tract shows:\r\n- GEOID (census tract number)\r\n- County and state\r\n- All eligibility flags\r\n- Distress metrics\r\n- Active projects in that tract\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Data Sources\r\n\r\nThe map aggregates authoritative federal data:\r\n\r\n| Data | Source | Update Frequency |\r\n|------|--------|------------------|\r\n| Census Tracts | US Census Bureau | Decennial |\r\n| NMTC Eligibility | CDFI Fund | Annual |\r\n| Opportunity Zones | IRS | Fixed (2018) |\r\n| QCTs/DDAs | HUD | Annual |\r\n| Poverty/Income | ACS 5-Year | Annual |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why This Matters\r\n\r\n### For Sponsors\r\n\r\n- Know instantly if your project qualifies\r\n- See ALL available programs in one view\r\n- No more manual tract research\r\n\r\n### For CDEs\r\n\r\n- Find projects in your target areas\r\n- Verify eligibility before engagement\r\n- Track deployment geography\r\n\r\n### For Investors\r\n\r\n- Filter opportunities by location criteria\r\n- Verify CRA eligibility\r\n- Map portfolio geography\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Map is the Source of Truth\r\n\r\nEvery data point flows from the map:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMAP DATA\r\n   │\r\n   ├── Intake Form (auto-populates eligibility)\r\n   │\r\n   ├── DealCard (displays tract info)\r\n   │\r\n   ├── AutoMatch (scores geographic fit)\r\n   │\r\n   └── Compliance (verifies requirements)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the map says a tract is eligible, the system treats it as eligible. When the map shows distress metrics, those drive scoring. The map is not decorative—it's authoritative.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Need Help?\r\n\r\nContact **support@tcredex.com** for map assistance."}
